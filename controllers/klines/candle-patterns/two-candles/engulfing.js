/*
Indication: Bullish/Bearish reversal
Reliability: Medium

Description: During a downtrend, the Bullish Engulfing depicts an opening at a new low and closes at or above the previous candle's open. This signifies that the downtrend has lost momentum and the bulls may be gaining strength.
Factors increasing the pattern's effectiveness are:

1) The first candlestick has a small real body and the second has a large real body.
2) Pattern appears after protracted or very fast move.
3) Heavy volume on second real body.
4) The second candlestick engulfs more than one real body.

This happens when price opens lower on the second day than the first dayâ€™s close, but price increases throughout the candle, closing higher than the opening of the first candle. The ideal way to trade this pattern (and any pattern) is to wait for confirmation on the following candle that price is continuing up
